for connecting the backend to frontend 
1. first create a proxy in package.json file in frontend folder like this
    "name": "frontend",
    "version": "0.1.0",
     "private": true,
     "proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:2001",  

2. Then wherever you want to fetch the data then you are going to use two things
    1. axios - it is used to fetch api keys.
    2. useEffect - it will render everyhing first when page will load up.


3. Create Models and making schema in it. we will be using mongoose in it.

4. create models for different models.

5. JWT = json web token.  This is helps us in authroization of the user. It sends the unique token to backend for getting the data of the partiular user.
